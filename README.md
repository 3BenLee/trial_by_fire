This is my attempt at building the Mercari list and detail page.

* In the pre-conditions it said to use HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It said not to use a 
  a React boilerplate, so I assumed you meant not to use React. I did
  the whole project with Javascript and JQuery. I hope I did not misinterpret the 
  pre-conditions. I did my best and put a lot of hours and sweat into it. It is 
  probably not the most elegant code, but I think it satisfies most of the
  challenge requirements.
 
* I built the project using gulp and sass. 

1- First, in your git change directories (cd) into the project directory `cd Mercari_Test`<br>

2- Tyoe `npm install`<br>

3- Then type in `npm start`<br>

4- browsersync should then load a localhost<br>

If you have any trouble, please email me.

My intentions:

I used the current Mercari display and the screenshots supplied. I wanted to make the "Sold" 
corner tag work/look better but time constraints got me. I styled it using the screenshots and 
the actual site as a reference. 

I tried my best on this one. I think I acclomplished a lot with only Javascript 
and jQuery. This was one of the toughest challenges I have ever taken on. I really 
wanted to style it more and give it some extra features but time was tight and I 
got a little caught up in solving other problems. Anyway, I hope you can appreciate
the effort. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to test for the position. In 
closing, if you choose not to move forward with my application I would still
really appreciate any feedback you could offer. I am always trying to get better 
and I feel constructive criticism is always helpful.
